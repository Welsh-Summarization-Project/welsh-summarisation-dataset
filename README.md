# Welsh Summarisation Dataset
This repo holds the Welsh Summarisation Dataset and Python demo scripts and notebooks. It is being actively updated at the moment, so keep watching the space.

### Dataset
This is a collection of 513 Welsh texts (Wikipedia articles) and their summaries. Each of the articles - containing at least 500 tokens in length - was extracted along with its Wikipedia summary using the [WikipediaAPI](https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/). The raw files - containing the Wikipedia extracted articles and summaries - are stored in [data.zip](data.zip) in html and plain text formats. The processed files are placed in a pickled pandas dataframe which can be viewed with [this colab file](dataset.ipynb).
